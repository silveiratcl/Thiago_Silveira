I am a biologist and researcher in the marine environment. Enthusiast of statistical modeling and information spatialization. I seek to learn new technologies that allow me to create products and solutions for the environmental sciences.

Studing HTML, CSS and Javascript for a future deepening in ReactJs and Native Native. Also interested in learn Node.js, PostgresSQL and Python. I've been studying the Leafleat.js library for data spatialization.

I live in Florianópolis and I am a SCUBA diver. Pedro's Father (2017). Family, surfing, skateboarding and the beach are good for me.
